# College-c-exercises
I translated a small part of my exercises to english and made them more clean and friendly to the final users. When i wrote most of these codes, I was making university work, so, the teachers made specific conditions for the variables and struct names. Most of these specific names were in portuguese, therefore, here I have an amount of code with variables/structs names in portuguese.

# About dates
I didn't use github to make the majority of these codes, i made them in my machine and published it months later. Then, it's possible (and the case in the majority of this repository) that the date is wrong. I made basic codes between may and september of 2020, and data structures/programming lab2 between 2020 october and 2021 february.
