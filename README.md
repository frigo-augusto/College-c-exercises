# College-c-exercises
I translated a small part of my exercises to english and made them more clean and friendly to the final users. When i wrote most of these codes, I was making university work, so, the teachers made specific conditions for the variables and struct names. Most of these specific names were in portuguese, therefore, here I have an amount of code in with variables/structs names in portuguese. I've moved most of the code archives, so, it's possible that the date of making them is wrong. In the folder Data Structure/Programming Lab II you will see most realistic and advanced code.
