# College-c-exercises
I translated a small part of my exercises to english and made them more clean and friendly to the final users. When i wrote most of this codes(specifically, the codes in the "in progress" folder), wasn't worried about make a clean thing, the original purpose was to exercise my logic. A good part of them were inicitially wrote in PT-BR.
