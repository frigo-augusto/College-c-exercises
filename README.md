# College-c-exercises
I translated a small part of my exercises to english and made them more clean and friendly to the final users. When i wrote this codes, wasn't worried about make a clean and readable code, so it's possible that they are not clear if not translated. I will finish the translations and make them clear later. All of them were inicitially made in PT-BR, so, if the program is in this language, I probally didn't touch the code. (I don't write codes in pt-br anymore)
